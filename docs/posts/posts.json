Figure 1 shows the Math proficiency scores of all the students against those of economically disadvantaged students and Figure 2 shows the mean percent of the students in Math by their economic status. The Math proficiency for economically disadvantaged students is lower than that of all students.\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the Reading proficiency scores of all the students against those of economically disadvantaged students and Figure 4 shows shows the mean percent of the students in Reading by their economic status. All students perform better than economically disadvantaged students.\nFigure 3\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
