We analyze the role of socioeconomic status (SES) by comparing performance between economically disadvantaged (ECD) students and all students across various grade levels.\nDataset Overview\nWe sourced data using {educationdata} and {janitor}, ensuring a standardized format. Key variables include:\nleaid – Local Education Agency (LEA) identifier\nProficiency percentages (pctprof) for both ECD students and all students, spanning different grade levels\nData Challenges\nThe dataset presents inconsistencies in how proficiency is reported, including:\nExact percentages (e.g., 75)\nRanges (e.g., 50–60)\nGreater than/Less than statements (e.g., “>80”)\nMissing values (e.g., \"n/a\" or \"PS\")\nTo standardize:\n- We extracted lower bounds from ranges and retained reported values for greater than/less than cases.\n- We removed non-numeric values and converted all valid entries to numeric format.\nHowever, significant missing data remains, potentially impacting our findings. Further steps may be needed to assess patterns of missingness and determine appropriate handling strategies.\nData Processing\nWe reshaped the dataset from wide to long format using the pivot_longer() function, producing a tidy dataset with the following structure:\nleaid – School district identifier\ngroup – Student category (all vs. ecd)\ngrade – Grade level or “all_grades”\nsubject – “math” or “rla”\npctprof – Percentage proficient\nResearch Questions\nWe seek to answer:\nHow does SES affect student proficiency in math and reading across different grade levels?\nAre there consistent trends over time that highlight disparities between ECD and non-ECD students?\nNext Steps\nWith the dataset cleaned and structured, our next step involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and assess SES-related disparities in educational outcomes.\nFuture Directions\nFollowing the presentation and feedback from peers and the instructor, several new questions emerged that we plan to address moving forward. As previously discussed, the data wrangling process for this project has proven challenging. One valuable suggestion was to provide additional context around trends by state. There may be certain policies influencing scores that would be better understood and visualized with this filtering. Upon a deeper review of the codebook, it was noted that LEID States submit data at three distinct education levels: state, LEA (Local Education Agency, which includes school districts), and school level.\nEach LEA is assigned a unique 7-digit ID by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), known as the NCES LEA Identification Number. The first two digits of this number form the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) state code, while the remaining five digits are unique within that state for the LEA. Similarly, each school within an LEA is assigned a unique 12-digit ID by NCES. The first seven digits correspond to the NCES LEA Identification Number, and the remaining five digits are unique to the specific school within the LEA. It’s important to note that these five digits may not be unique within the state.\nBeginning in the 2016-17 school year, two new fields—ST_LEAID and ST_SCHID—were added to the LEA and school-level assessment files in the Common Core of Data (CCD) to improve the identification of districts and schools within states, as well as their connection to other CCD data files.\nAdditionally, we received the suggestion to create a side-by-side visual comparing math and reading data, which we have implemented. Further analysis can be conducted in these areas to identify trends within specific districts across different grades. Additionally, exploring alternative methods of cleaning the data by state may yield more useful insights and enable a more granular understanding of the data.\n\n\n\n",
