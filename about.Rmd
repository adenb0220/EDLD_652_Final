## Introduction

![Learn GIF](images/learn.gif)

This study examines student proficiency trends in **reading/language arts (RLA)** and **math** from **2010–2019**, using data from **EDFacts**. We analyze the role of **socioeconomic status (SES)** by comparing performance between **economically disadvantaged (ECD) students** and **all students** across various grade levels.

## Dataset Overview

We sourced data using `{educationdata}` and `{janitor}`, ensuring a standardized format. Key variables include:

- **`leaid`** – Local Education Agency (LEA) identifier  
- **Proficiency percentages** (`pctprof`) for both **ECD students** and **all students**, spanning different grade levels  

## Data Challenges

The dataset presents **inconsistencies in how proficiency is reported**, including:

- **Exact percentages** (e.g., 75)  
- **Ranges** (e.g., 50–60)  
- **Greater than/Less than statements** (e.g., ">80")  
- **Missing values** (e.g., `"n/a"` or `"PS"`)  

To standardize:  
- We **extracted lower bounds from ranges** and retained reported values for **greater than/less than** cases.  
- We **removed non-numeric values** and converted all valid entries to **numeric format**.  

However, **significant missing data remains**, potentially impacting our findings. Further steps may be needed to assess patterns of missingness and determine appropriate handling strategies.

## Data Processing

We reshaped the dataset from **wide** to **long format** using the `pivot_longer()` function, producing a tidy dataset with the following structure:

- **`leaid`** – School district identifier  
- **`group`** – Student category (all vs. ecd)  
- **`grade`** – Grade level or "all_grades"  
- **`subject`** – "math" or "rla"  
- **`pctprof`** – Percentage proficient  

## Research Questions

We seek to answer:

1. **How does SES affect student proficiency in math and reading across different grade levels?**
2. **Are there consistent trends over time that highlight disparities between ECD and non-ECD students?**

## Next Steps

With the dataset cleaned and structured, our next step involves **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to visualize trends and assess SES-related disparities in educational outcomes.
